# tsb-savestate-multitool

A couple of GUI "tools" built from shared code that can be used on a save state for the Nintendo game Tecmo Super Bowl: A condition checker and a statistic extractor.

## Description

I've written similar things in Perl over the years, but wanted to try to build something in a more modern framework with GUI. This was written in C# 12.0 using Visual Studio 2022.
